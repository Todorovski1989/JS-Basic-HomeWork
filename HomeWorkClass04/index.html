    <h1>HomeWork #1</h1>
    <p><b>Create a function called tellStory()

            The function should accept an array of 3 strings as an argument: name, mood, activity ( All strings ) <br>

            The function should return one big string with a story made from the arguments <br>

            Example: This is *name*. *name* is a nice person. Today they are *mood*. They are *activity* all day. The
            end.<br>

            The value that is returned from the function should be printed in the console or in alert.</b></p>
    <h1>HomeWork #2</h1>
    <p><b>Write a function that will take an array of 5 numbers as an argument and return the sum. <br>

            Print it in the console or in alert <br>

            BONUS: Write another function called validateNumber() that checks if a number is a valid number and call it
            for every number. <br> If one of the numbers of the array is invalid show an error message instead of a
            result.</b></p>
